# **Machine Learning: Course Project**

The goal of this project will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict how well study participants performed certain exercises in a test set of measurements. 

The`MLProject.rmd` does the following
1)	Downloads training and test data sets from the source
2)	Tidies and cleans the data
3)	Reduces dimensions of the data
4)	Partitions data for cross validation
5)	Fits the data with three models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Boosting
6)  Runs the testing data through the model with highest accuracy (Random Forest)
